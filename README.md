## What is this
A tool made to keep track of what to fill in on **Hydra** (Citrix App) at the end of the week.
A timer makes the tool popup and requires you to fill in what you've done. At the end of the week, the user can view how much time he/she has spent on which project.
Free to use for anyone, although this repository lays its focus on offering the best functionality for Barco NV employees.

## Updates
The tool checks for updates on start.
If you want to disable it, change the code and recompile.

## PreCompiled and ready to use
Download: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bW8nKafGaQjiept200WR01d66ibY5_MK
(On first start, update will be performed and all files will be downloaded.)

Keep in mind, this tool will be updated for use at Barco NV.
For private use, it's recommended to alter the code and compile your own version.
